<h1>The best Movies according to Pieter</h1>

<h2>My favourite movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Animation</h3>
<h4>Berzerk</h4>
<p>
This one is hard to explain. The art style is unique and the story is gripping. Not for everyone as it can
be a lot to take in at times, some scenes are explisit and tragic but this just builds and adds
to the complexity of Guts's character.

<h4>Gost in the Shell</h4>

<h3>Drama</h3>
<h4>The Jacket</h4>
<p>
I love this movie due to the emotions and its ability to make you feel for the character. It also makes you think about reality.
The musical score is also haunting. It just seems to have stuck with me
</p>
<h4>Green Street Hooligans</h4>
<p>
This was a favourite in my younger days. It made me also want to become more self sufficient, grow with close friends, and become my own person, doing stuff for me.
</p>

<h3>Adventure</h3>
<h4>Into the Wild</h4>
<p>
This movie is great, it's a coming of age film, and the thoughts about the meaning of modern day life and just going on an adventure are unique.
Its sad in the end but it makes you think on your own life and if you have even lived it.

<h3>Sci Fi</h3>
<h4>Bladerunner</h4>
<h4>Ex Machina</h4>
