<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm Pieter. I am a 3D artist from South Africa.</p>

<p>I have a love for all things tech related, especially computer graphics. My main focus is on environment art, but I have also developed
  a love for computer science and programming. I am currently a beginner python user, learning how to create scripts and tools in Maya. I would love
  to code and develop my own indie game in the future.
</p>

<p>I am always learnign and developing my skills, whether it be in programming or 3D art. I enjoy the process and challenge of learning new skills,
  and I don't believe I would ever stop doing tutorials or short courses.
